Docker is a great tool for software development since it synchronises your team with the same setup for everyone who collaborates in your project. That's fantastic!

Running rails in a Docker Container is pretty straightforward, let's begin by creating a Rails application and then configure a custom Docker Image so we can run the Rails application from there.

* Ruby version - 2.5.5

* Rails version - 5.2.1

* Postgresql

* Created two containers. One is for rails app & another is for db.
